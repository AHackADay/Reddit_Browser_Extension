# Reddit_Browser_Extension

This is a chrome web extension written in javascript.

If you go to reddit.com it will hide your reddit username in the following places:
- just the text on the top right of the page on regular pages
- top left of the page on the profile page (where the url is like this: /u/foo or /user/foo)
- top right titlebox section on the profile page (where the url is like this: /u/foo or /user/foo)

Note that it will only fire after the page loads so your username will briefly be visible on page load
